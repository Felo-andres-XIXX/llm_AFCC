However, one common explanation is that blue color is caused by a combination of light in different wavelengths that have been absorbed by various substances within our atmosphere.\n\nDifferent colors are produced when different wavelengths of sunlight fall on the Earth's surface and are refracted or bent by the atmosphere. The atmosphere has the ability to absorb certain wavelengths of light, which can lead to the coloration of objects around us. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun are particularly strong in the blue region of the spectrum, which explains why blue skies are common.\n\nIn addition to the atmosphere, other factors such as cloud cover and precipitation also play a role in determining the color of the sky. Clouds block incoming light, causing it to bend and scatter, resulting in the appearance of light colors. Precipitation can cause droplets to form on the surface of clouds, leading to different hues of blue depending on the size and shape of these droplets.\n\nOverall, while the reason why the sky is blue is complex and multifaceted, it is a natural phenomenon that results from a combination of factors in our atmosphere and surrounding environment.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,1234,304,376,14606,338,278,14744,7254,3026,508,29915,29873,367,10824,411,16021,24481,7432,29892,408,727,526,2999,13879,393,29126,304,967,10097,29889,2398,29892,697,3619,8252,338,393,7254,2927,338,8581,491,263,10296,310,3578,297,1422,10742,2435,4141,9499,393,505,1063,17977,2580,491,5164,5960,2925,2629,1749,25005,29889,13,13,26023,4578,29873,11955,526,7371,746,1422,10742,2435,4141,9499,310,6575,4366,6416,373,278,11563,29915,29879,7101,322,526,2143,1461,287,470,26148,491,278,25005,29889,450,25005,756,278,11509,304,17977,29890,3058,10742,2435,4141,9499,310,3578,29892,607,508,3275,304,278,2927,362,310,3618,2820,502,29889,18514,5705,601,1026,313,29965,29963,29897,15570,29879,515,278,6575,526,10734,4549,297,278,7254,5120,310,278,18272,29892,607,18568,2020,7254,14993,267,526,3619,29889,13,13,797,6124,304,278,25005,29892,916,13879,1316,408,9570,4612,322,25720,7018,884,1708,263,6297,297,11806,292,278,2927,310,278,14744,29889,14293,29879,2908,23235,3578,29892,10805,372,304,3856,29881,322,14801,29892,9819,297,278,10097,310,3578,11955,29889,4721,7334,7018,508,4556,5768,10376,304,883,373,278,7101,310,27091,29892,8236,304,1422,22888,267,310,7254,8679,373,278,2159,322,8267,310,1438,5768,10376,29889,13,13,3563,497,29892,1550,278,2769,2020,278,14744,338,7254,338,4280,322,2473,2161,9446,29892,372,338,263,5613,27791,265,393,2582,515,263,10296,310,13879,297,1749,25005,322,18830,5177,29889],"total_duration":17688823849,"load_duration":778844387,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":1639555000,"eval_count":292,"eval_duration":15226042000}
